# Zookeepr

# Description

In this module, I created a web server that used the Express.js framework and added it to a front-end application that the local zoo is developing, called Zoo Keepr. The site’s data will live on the server I built so that anyone can access it without having to download it. I also deployed my application to Heroku, a cloud application platform that allows you to deploy applications with servers to a webpage.
